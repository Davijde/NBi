A reverse-lookup must be considered when you want to be sure that the candidate result-set effectively contains each key available in your reference resut-set.

At the opposite of equivalence's tests, lookup's tests don't require the uniqueness of the rows in the reference or candidate result-sets. If a key from the reference result-set is not found in the candidate resut-set then the test will fail.

## System-under-test

The system under-test is any result-set representing the candidate table.

## Assertion

The assertion is defined by the xml element *lookup-exists* and the attribute *reverse* sets to *true*. The other parts of the assertion are identical to the parts defined for the [*lookup-exists* test](../lookup-exists).

{% highlight xml %}
<assert>
  <lookup-exists reverse="true">
    <join>
      <using column="#0" type="text"/>
    </join>
    <result-set>
      <query>...</query>
    </result-set>
  </lookup-exists>
</assert>
{% endhighlight %}
